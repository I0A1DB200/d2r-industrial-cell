# 02 · Engineering drawings · Revision B approved

D2R approved Revision B for conceptual teaching use. The sheets relate the mechanical route, simulator sequence, Watch tags, and utilities. Undefined data is marked; addresses, component models, and sizing values have not been invented. This review does not release the designs for manufacturing, wiring, or installation.

## Interface decision still open

In the simulator, `DO_PusherValve` stays at 1 during both `DISCHARGE` (push) and `PUSH_RETRACT` (return), although the graphical actuator reverses direction. This tag alone does not define the command for a real valve. Before selecting a valve or mapping outputs, decide how extend and retract are commanded and which physical confirmations are required. The sheets record this discrepancy; simulator logic and timings were not changed.

## Basis and open work

- **Teaching assumptions:** 24 VDC control and dry filtered air at a nominal 6 bar. Pressure has not been measured; loads and consumption have not been calculated.
- **Graphical references:** HTML coordinates and travel. They are not workshop dimensions or verified measurements.
- **Hardware pending:** site AC supply, CPU/modules, field devices, drive, camera, actuators, valves, terminals, protection, and addresses.
- **Calculation/validation pending:** loads, forces, strokes, flow, stability, tolerances, wiring, and physical tests.
- **Safety:** architecture and response to loss of power/air remain subject to risk assessment; `SafetyReady` is still a simulated signal.

## Drawing checks

The sheets were rendered with Inkscape and visually checked for text fit. All three SVG files pass XML parsing, and their links from documents 02 ES/EN resolve. No CAD work, calculations, hardware testing, or Safety validation was performed.
